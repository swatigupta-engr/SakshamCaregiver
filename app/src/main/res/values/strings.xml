			<p align="right">
            Regular assessment and charting of few important physical parameters by the doctor at fixed intervals is called physical health monitoring.
        It includes few simple physical tests such as Blood pressure, pulse monitoring etc. performed by the doctor during your visit and some blood investigations.
        The interval of monitoring (e.g. monthly, weekly etc.) will be decided by your treating doctor and communicated to you.
                Physical health monitoring is an integral part in the management of patients with schizophrenia. </p>
		</item>
        <item>People with schizophrenia have increased rates of physical illness compared with the general population.
        Research has shown that the life expectancy of people with schizophrenia is reduced by 10 years as compared to general population.</item>
        <item>There are several reasons for increased physical health problems:\n
        - Lack of monitoring and assessment of various parameters which can help in early detection of physical problems.\n
        - The health care needs of patients with mental illnesses are sometimes overlooked.\n
        - Patients with schizophrenia are often not able to communicate their physical problems to the doctor clearly.\n
        - Improper dietary habits\n
        - Lack of physical activity\n
        - Disturbances in lifestyle due to schizophrenia (e.g. poor self-care, disturbed sleep etc.)\n
        - Not following treatment regimen properly. (poor adherence)\n
        - Co-morbid substance use disorders (alcohol, tobacco, cannabis) worsens the physical health.\n
        - Side effects of medications
        </item>
        <item>Early detection of physical problems leads to effective management
        It can prevent development of full-blown metabolic disorders such as Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, if corrected early.
        It motivates lifestyle modifications at the earliest which also helps in improvement of physical health
        Side effects of medicines are also detected early.

    <item>
        <li>Hello! Thanks for connecting with us. I will be sharing with you some basic information about Schizophrenia and how to support your family member who is suffering from Schizophrenia.</li>
</item>
        <item>
            <li>Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. It interferes with an individual’s ability to perceive the world around them in the same way that the majority of people do. </li>\n
    </item>
        <item>
        <li>Schizophrenia is also one of the poorly understood illnesses. There are various myths associated with Schizophrenia. Evidence gathered from studies and real narratives indicate that the following myths (though prevalent) are not true. </li>\n
    </item>
        <item>
        <li><b>Truth:</b> Schizophrenia is not rare; the lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia is widely accepted to be around 1 in 100. People living with schizophrenia don’t prefer to talk about it due to stigma. This makes the illness seem rare or non-existent.</li>\n
    </item>
        <item>
<li><b>Truth:</b>  Most people with schizophrenia are neither violent nor a danger to others. There may be a few situations where you might see your family member becoming agitated. For instance, if he/she is questioned or confronted directly about their experience of hallucinations or delusions.  There are ways to deal with such situations that we will be talking in this module.</li>\n
    </item>
        <item>

<li><b>Truth:</b>  The modern science offers effective treatments for Schizophrenia. Long-term treatment may be required (as it is required in many other illnesses such as Diabetes, hypertension) and when treated properly, many people with schizophrenia are able to enjoy fulfilling, productive lives. </li>\n

    </item>
        <item>

<li><b>Truth:</b>  Medicines prescribed for schizophrenia are not addictive. If taken properly as prescribed by your  doctor, they can be eventually tapered and stopped. </li>\n

    </item>


        <item>
        <li><b>Truth:</b>  Treatment if started early can lead to decrease in symptoms and improvement in functioning of patients with schizophrenia. There are  interventions that families can implement to help the person lead a more productive and normalized life.</li>\n
    </item>

        <item>
        <li>The above misconceptions about Schizophrenia are baseless. It is important that we try to challenge these wrong perceptions whenever possible.</li>\n
<li>Further, you should talk openly with your psychiatrist about any query or concern you may have about Schizophrenia. This will help you to get more factual and scientific information. </li>\n
</item>


        <item>
            <li>It takes time to understand the real symptoms and signs of Schizophrenia that your family member may be experiencing.
The common signs and symptoms of the illness are: </li>\n
    </item>

        <item>


<li><b>Hallucination:</b> Person perceive things that don’t actually exist in the reality. These may include a person hearing voices, seeing things, or smelling things that others can’t hear or see or smell. </li>\n
<li>Please remember that the hallucinations appear real to the person experiencing it, and they it may be very confusing for the family members. Don’t engage in arguments/counter arguments about the content of hallucination with the patient.</li>\n</item>


        <item>


<li><b>Delusions:</b> These are false beliefs that don’t change even when the person who holds them is presented with the new/contradicting ideas or facts. People who have delusions often also have problems concentrating, confused thinking, or the sense that their thoughts are blocked.</li>
<li>Don’t engage in the explanation of delusions or counter arguments with the patient. You don’t have to agree or support the delusional thinking of the person but at the same time don’t challenge them upfront. </li>\n
<li>Both hallucinations and delusions are symptoms of the illness and continued medication helps in alleviation of these symptoms. </li>
        </item>
        <item>
            <li><b>Negative symptoms:</b> Negative Symptoms are associated with disturbance and disruption in the  normal emotions and behaviours. You may  observe that the </li>\n
		<li>\u2022 person has lost interest in the day to day activities</li>\n
		<li>\u2022 he is not reacting to any good/bad event like other people</li>\n
		<li>\u2022 he is speaking little or not at all </li>\n
		<li>\u2022 seems to have a reduced ability to start or carry out even most basic activities (like brushing teeth, eating meals on time, going out of the house)</li>\n
		<li>\u2022 is not interacting with other people or is interacting very little sporadically.  </li>\n

    </item>
        <item>
        <li>You can help the patient in alleviation of negative symptoms by taking small and consistent steps with them. Help the patient to prepare a schedule that involves doable and achievable activities of daily living. Integrate some pleasurable and social activities in their schedule. Appreciate their efforts (no matter how small or insignificant they might appear to you) taken in the direction of living a better life. </li>\n
    </item>

        <item>
        <li> <b>Cognitive symptoms:</b> For some patients, the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia can be severe and there may be noticeable changes in their memory or other aspects of thinking. Symptoms include trouble in focussing attention, poor ability to understand the information, difficulty in making decisions about seemingly simple issues, and trouble in implementing the instructions.</li>ln

        <li>You can help the patient by simplifying the information for them. It also helps to break the task in smaller sub tasks and attaching simple and specific instruction with each sub task. </li>\n
    </item>
        <item>
        <li><b>Other symptoms: </b> \n
            <li>\u2022 Changes in usual behaviour: preference to stay alone, getting irritated on trivial issues.</li>\n
            <li>\u2022 Changes in sleep pattern: staying awake late in nights, preferring to spent most of the time on bed </li>\n
            <li>\u2022 Odd behaviours: smiling for no reason, muttering to self, maintaining too much of secrecy</li>\n
            <li>\u2022 Decreased self-care: not interested in taking bath or maintaining hygiene</li>\n
            <li>\u2022 The speech of the patients may be vague, disordered or muddled and may be hard to understand. It may appear meaningless due to lack of logical connection between sentences or phrases or words.</li>\n
            <li>\u2022 Complaints about physical / bodily symptoms (such as bodyaches, headache etc )</li>\n
            <li>\u2022 Feeling anxiety or ghabrahat:</li>\n
            <li>\u2022 If the patient is complaining of feeling anxious or tensed in social situations (or even otherwise) don’t ignore it. Talk to the doctor about it during your follow up
            </li>\n</li>\n

    </item>
        <item>
        <li>Schizophrenia is an illness with primarily biological causes. \n

            <li><b>Neurotransmitter Imbalance:</b> The brain is made up of nerve cells, called neurons, and chemicals, called neurotransmitters. An imbalance of these neurotransmitter especially, dopamine, is thought to cause the symptoms of schizophrenia. The medications used for treatment of schizophrenia try to restore the imbalance of neurotransmitters. </li>\n</li>\n</item>
        <item>
        <li><b>Genetics:</b> Scientists have long known that schizophrenia sometimes runs in families. Scientists believe that many different genes may increase the risk of schizophrenia, but that no single gene causes the disorder by itself. It is not yet possible to use genetic information to predict who will develop schizophrenia.</li>\n
        <li>There are many people who have schizophrenia who don’t have a family member with the disorder and conversely, many people with one or more family members with the disorder who do not develop it themselves. </li>\n
    </item>

        <item>
        <li><b>Environmental Factors:</b> Scientists also think that interactions between genes and aspects of the individual’s environment are necessary for schizophrenia to develop. Environmental factors may involve: </li>\n
        <li>\u2022 Exposure to viruses </li>\n
        <li>\u2022 Malnutrition before birth</li>\n
        <li>\u2022 Problems during birth</li>\n
        <li>\u2022 Psychosocial factors</li>\n

        <li>Their interaction differs from individual to individual and depends to one’s unique biological makeup and psychosocial environment. </li>\n
    </item>
        <item>
        <li> There are numerous factors that lead to development of schizophrenia in an individual. These factors interact in multiple and complex ways so one can’t say what exactly might have caused the illness.  It is important to acknowledge that there is no one single factor or person to be held responsible for the illness. </li>\n
    </item>


        <item>
        <li> <b>Pharmacological treatment:</b> Antipsychotic medications are usually taken daily in pill or liquid form. Some antipsychotics are injections that are given once or twice a month. Some people have side effects when they start taking medications, but most side effects go away after a few days. Doctors and patients can work together to find the best medication or medication combination, and the right dose.
        </li>\n
    </item>
        <item>
        <li><b>Psychosocial Treatments:</b> These treatments involve learning of specific psychological and social skills by both the patient and their family member to address the everyday challenges of schizophrenia. </li>\n
        <li>The current study is about development of mobile based psychosocial treatments that can be delivered from home. </li>\n
    </item>


        <item>
        <li>The treatment plan of a patient is formulated by a case-to-case basis by a mental health professional after thorough assessment. For treatment to be successful, it is important to follow the treatment regimen diligently and follow-up regularly as and when asked by the doctor. </li>\n
    </item>
        <item>
        <li>Caring for and supporting a loved one with schizophrenia can be hard. It can be difficult to know how to respond to someone who may be exhibiting behaviour that appears bizarre, may be unresponsive to your requests and is not ready to take initiative for anything. </li>\n
        <li>Here are some things you can do to help your loved one: </li>\n


    </item>


        <item>

        <li><b>Ensure the Treatment Adherence:</b> \n
            <li>\u2022 Encourage the patient to take the medication regularly. You can also assist them in taking the medicines on time by using simple reminder techniques, such as setting an alarm, maintaining a pills box etc </li>\n
            <li>\u2022 If the family member experiences discomfort or side-effects with any form of treatment, it is essential to discuss about it with the treating doctor instead of stopping treatment abruptly. Abrupt stoppage of medication can lead to sudden exacerbations in system, worsening the course and prognosis of the illness. </li>\n
        <li>\u2022 Keep up with the regular follow-ups with the treating psychiatrist. It serves two major purposes. First it helps to monitor medicinal compliance and second to adjust the therapeutic level of medications. </li>\n
        <li>\u2022 Keep a written note of any important incident or an observation you might have. This will help you to remember the key issues that you want to discuss with the doctor. </li>\n
    </li>\n
</item>
        <item>

    <li><b>Know the early signs of relapse:</b> </li>\n
<li>\u2022 Discuss the early warning signs of relapse with the treating psychiatrist. Develop a plan of action about what can be done as soon as you see the early signs of the relapse. </li>\n</item>
        <item>

    <li><b>Learn to respond to the symptoms of illness </b></li>\n
<li>Hallucinations/delusions </li>\n
<li>\u2022 Remember that their beliefs or hallucinations seem very real to them. Don’t challenge them or indulge in arguments/counter arguments about them. </li>\n
<li>\u2022 Express your disagreement with the content of hallucinations/delusions in a matter of fact manner. Don’t indulge in discussions or challenging the experience of the patient. </li>\n
<li>\u2022 At the same time, delusions and hallucinations may be distressing for the patient. You can help the patient in easing off the distress. You can help them distract their mind or relax by indulging in some activity together.  </li>\n

</item>


        <item>
    <li><b>Dangerous /inappropriate behaviour:</b> </li>\n
<li>\u2022 Be supportive of the patient without tolerating dangerous or inappropriate behaviour. </li>\n
<li>\u2022 Express yourself using short, specific sentences that you don’t appreciate and accept the inappropriate behaviour. </li>\n
<li>\u2022 Don’t use intimidating language or threaten the patient.  </li>\n
<li>\u2022 You can seek help of other family members to ensure your and patients safety.</li>\n
<li>\u2022 After the incident is over, discuss it with the patient and the doctor about how to avert such unacceptable behaviours in the future. </li>\n

</item>
        <item>

    <li><b>Communicating with the patient</b></li>\n
<li>Keep in mind the following simple principles while communicating with the person:  </li>\n
<li>\u2022 Talk in small, simple and direct sentences</li>\n
<li>\u2022 Focus on one topic at a time. Don’t give more than one instruction at a time or talk about multiple topics</li>\n
<li>\u2022 Remain consistent, with regards to your style of talking with the patient and your expectations from them</li>\n
<li>\u2022 Don’t use critical or intimidating language   </li>\n
<li>\u2022 Don’t pressurize the patient to do an activity </li>\n
<li>\u2022 Remain supportive and appear available when you are with them </li>\n
<li>\u2022 Use positive reinforcements or appreciations of them, whenever possible</li>\n
<li>\u2022 Don’t shy away from expressing your disapproval of the unacceptable/dangerous behaviour, without using harsh and threatening language. </li>\n

</item>
        <item>
<li> Situations can arise with the patient that may require your direct intervention. Some of such situations can be when the patient stops taking the medicine, is not taking care of hygiene or is not maintaining their schedule. In such situations, following the problem solving techniques can help.
    Problem solving technique involves the following steps:</li>\n
<li>\u2022 Focus on the immediate problem behavior. Describe the problem specifically and in straightforward way (for instance instead of stating the problem as ‘ You are not maintaining hygiene’ , describe the exact problem behaviors like you are not bathing everyday / You haven’t brushed for 3 days)
</li>\n<li>\u2022 Talk to the patient about the potential costs and benefits attached to this behavior
</li>\n<li>\u2022 You can give your inputs too
</li>\n<li>\u2022 Discuss with the patient about possible course of action, based on the cost and benefit analysis
</li>\n<li>\u2022 Talk about the possible ways you can assist them in following up the course of action chosen by them </li>\n
</item>

        <item>
<li>The problem solving skills are applicable in various situations. It is important that you start to practice these skills with the patient for problems that are concrete, current and in the situations where the patient has the capacity/ability to engage in the alternate behaviour (or to change their behaviour).  </li>\n
<li>Remember to use the communication skills while problem solving with the patient. </li>\n
</item>
        <item>
<li>For some people suffering from the symptoms of schizophrenia, things such as personal hygiene can become difficult to maintain. Teaching or encouraging participation in basic skills such as laundry, cooking, and other ways to care for a home and oneself, can help build self-esteem and motivation. </li>\n
</item>
        <item>

<li>\u2022 Along with the patient, arrive at a list of daily activities that the patient needs to learn or practice. </li>\n
<li>\u2022 Together mark the activities that the patient can do independently or those they might need assistance with.  </li>\n
<li>\u2022 The patient can define each task as a personal goal </li>\n
<li>\u2022 Break each task into smaller and achievable subtasks </li>\n
<li>\u2022 Patient can learn the new tasks by observing you and then doing them with assistance from you till they feel confident of doing them independently. </li>\n
<li>\u2022 Reward and appreciate the achievements of personal goals and completion of activities. </li>\n
<li>\u2022 If the patient is unable to complete a particular task, it is important to understand the reason for it and address the real problem (you can use the problem solving technique here) </li>\n
<li>\u2022 Remain consistent in your communication, expectations and support to the patient </li>\n
</item>
        <item>
<li>It is important that while you are helping your family member to live a normal life, you should neither be over involved and nor absent from their day to day life.  Don’t complete the tasks for the patient. You may assist them in completion of these tasks. The purpose of assistance should be to help the patient become independent.  </li>\n
<li>While you are at it, remember that the Rome was not built in a day. </li>\n
</item>

        <item>
<li>Certain situations might invoke anxiety or fear. You might find that the patient is unable to perform even simple tasks that know well enough in places that are crowded. For instance, they may feel anxious in travelling by bus alone. Talk to the patient about their fear and anxiety. Provide reassurance. </li>\n
</item>
        <item>
<li>You can follow the following steps of graded desensitization to help alleviate anxiety </li>\n
<li>\u2022 Divide the task into small units of behavior or sub - tasks. For instance, the patient is feeling anxious to travel alone by metro to see the doctor. Together with the patient, divide it into specific tasks that the patient will have to take in order to travel alone. </li>\n
<li>\u2022 Identify the least anxiety provoking behavior that they can do and start with it. </li>\n
<li>For instance, patient can start to travel by metro along with a family member during the non-rush hours.</li>\n
<li>\u2022 Gradually, you can ask the patient to start performing the tasks independently. </li>\n
<li>For instance, the patient may buy the ticket while you are standing a little away. </li>\n
<li>\u2022 Once the patient has mastered performing one task move to another task. </li>\n
<li>\u2022 As the patient starts to perform the task independently, you can let them feel more prepared. For instance,  the patient can keep a route map or important phone numbers while travelling alone </li>\n
</item>

        <item>
<li>Taking care of physical health is important for patients with schizophrenia and their family members.</li>\n

<li>There are some steps that you can take to ensure that you and your family members are leading a healthy life
</li>\n
</item>
        <item>
    <li><b>Physical checkups:</b> \n
    <li>\u2022 Some common and vital tests may be important. Some of the tests that doctors often suggest for the patient include monitoring the weight, cholesterol blood pressure, blood sugar level and Hemoglobin.  There might be some more tests that your doctor would ask you to get done.</li>\n
    <li>\u2022 It is important that you get all the tests done immediately after doctor’s advise.</li>\n
    <li>\u2022 The current app has a built in module for you to track the findings on these tests.</li>\n
    <li>\u2022 Some of the medication for schizophrenia might lead to weight gain as a side effect. Weight gain can lead to more problems in future. It is important for you to get the weight checked periodically and enter the same in the app. The current  app will calculate the BMI and give you your current BMI. The app will also show variation in weight over time. If there is any rapid weight change you observe, please talk about it with your doctor in next visit.</li>\n
    <li>\u2022 Similarly, the app tracks findings for all other tests. You can observe variations in test findings and talk to your doctor in case there is anything that requires an immediate attention. </li>\n
    <li>\u2022 In case of health concern, talk to your doctor immediately. Don’t  take Over the Counter medicine without consulting your doctor. </li>\n
</li>\n
</item>
        <item>
    <li><b>Staying active</b>\n
    <li>\u2022 Patients with schizophrenia may not feel like doing much all day. This may be a part of illness. However, this is not good for their physical well-being.</li>\n
    <li>\u2022 Patient should be encouraged to engage in some physical activity each day. The patient can decide what activity they want to take up to take care of their physical health. It can be walking, running, playing a physical sport or Exercising/Yoga.</li>\n
